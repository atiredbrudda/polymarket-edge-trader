# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Surface where smart money is moving in eSports markets so the user can see what informed traders are doing and factor that into their own thinking.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 4 of 4 complete (Phase 1 COMPLETE)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 01-04-PLAN.md

Progress: [████████░░] 100% (Phase 1: 4/4 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 7.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation | 4/4 | 30min | 7.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4min, 6min, 3min, 17min
- Trend: Increasing complexity (plan 04 integration layer)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Event-first discovery approach: Start from active events to find traders, then backtrack their history (avoids scanning entire trader database)
- Custom taxonomy over Polymarket categories: Game-level granularity needed for niche detection (CS:GO vs LoL vs Dota 2)
- Hourly polling, not real-time: Awareness tool doesn't need sub-minute latency; reduces API pressure
- CLI + webhooks, no web UI: Prove signal quality first before investing in UI
- SQLite local-first storage: No external database infrastructure for v1
- **[01-01] Numeric columns for Decimal precision:** Use Numeric(20,6) for volumes, Numeric(10,6) for prices to avoid float errors
- **[01-01] SQLite WAL mode enabled:** Better write concurrency for data ingestion pipeline
- **[01-01] Category-agnostic data model:** detail_categories list configurable, no hardcoded eSports in business logic
- **[01-01] Virtual environment required:** Homebrew Python externally-managed, requires .venv/ activation
- **[01-02] Token bucket rate limiting:** Deque-based timestamp tracking with threading.Lock for thread safety
- **[01-02] Pydantic field validators:** Handle both ISO strings and Unix timestamps for dates
- **[01-02] Price validation range:** 0 < price < 1 (exclusive bounds) per Polymarket constraints
- **[01-02] Pagination cursor handling:** Terminates on next_cursor == 'LTE' or empty string
- **[01-03] Set-based category lookup:** O(1) case-insensitive category matching for filtering
- **[01-03] Decimal arithmetic:** All financial calculations use Decimal type to prevent float precision loss
- **[01-04] Event-first discovery:** Fetch active events → markets → discover traders from market trades
- **[01-04] Per-trader transactions:** Each trader ingestion commits independently to prevent cascade failures
- **[01-04] Multi-level deduplication:** Markets (condition_id), trades (trade_id), summaries (trader+category)
- **[01-04] Batch commit optimization:** Markets committed every 100 records for efficiency

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- ✓ COMPLETE - All DATA requirements fulfilled (DATA-01 through DATA-06)
- ✓ API client, filters, ingestion pipeline, and query layer operational
- ✓ 62 tests passing across all foundation components

**Phase 2 (Classification & Discovery):**
- eSports taxonomy structure: Need specific understanding of how Polymarket categorizes eSports markets (tournament naming conventions, regional splits)
- Research flag: MEDIUM priority for domain knowledge validation

**Phase 3-4 (Evaluation & Scoring):**
- Expertise score weighting: Formula coefficients require tuning via backtests on historical data
- Out-of-sample validation strategy needed to avoid overfitting
- Game patch tracking integration: Need reliable source for patch releases to tag markets with game versions
- Research flag: HIGH priority for scoring algorithm design

**Phase 5 (Signal Detection):**
- Consensus threshold calibration: 75% expert agreement is hypothesis, needs validation
- Herding detection timing thresholds: 2-hour window and 6-hour gaps are heuristics requiring historical validation
- Research flag: MEDIUM priority for threshold tuning
